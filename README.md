# Hungry Bruno

A proposed solution to the assignment given by Alemeno for internship.
It is a simple app where we need to click images and feed the animal. 
 
I tried to gamify the approach with maintaining score and the size of animal increases eahc time you feed.

## ScreenShots

<table>
     <tr>
        <td>
            <img src='images/land_screen.jpg' alt='Land Screen'>
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src='images/click_screen_1.jpg' alt='Click Screen 1'>
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src='images/click_screen_2.jpg' alt='Click Screen 2'>
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src='images/share_screen.jpg' alt='Share Screen'>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <img src='images/message_screen.jpg' alt='Message Screen'>
        </td>
       
   
</table>
