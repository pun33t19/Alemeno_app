# Hungry Bruno

A proposed solution to the assignment given by Alemeno for internship.
It is a simple app where we need to click images and feed the animal. 
 
I tried to gamify the approach with maintaining score and the size of animal increases each time you feed.

Bonus points covered in my app:
 - Storing the uploaded images to firebase
 - Showing camera preview inside the black circle
 - Sending a notification when the image is uploaded saying “Thank you for sharing
   food with me”
 - Matching the design.


## ScreenShots

     <tr>
        <td>
            <img src='images/land_screen.jpg' alt='Land Screen'>
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src='images/click_screen_1.jpg' alt='Click Screen 1'>
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src='images/click_screen_2.jpg' alt='Click Screen 2'>
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src='images/share_screen.jpg' alt='Share Screen'>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <img src='images/message_screen.jpg' alt='Message Screen'>
        </td>
       
   
</table>
